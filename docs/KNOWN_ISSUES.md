# Known issues and open questions

- **The executable and modules must be plaintext ELFs.** psvrecore reads no encrypted SELF; the version check
  refuses anything but the update 01.01's plaintext executable.
- **26 imported functions are missing** (online rankings, the game update check, the Store, and a few of libc's,
  libfios2's and libult's: [GAME_REPORT.md](GAME_REPORT.md)); none is called on the way to the menus. A call to one
  stops the program.
- **Songs run at 11-17 frames a second** (menus at 30) on the development laptop (RTX 4060): the game waits for two
  vertical blanks a frame and takes longer than that to make one. Notes move in steps and the judgement jitters by
  about a frame; the automatic player's best offset (−70 ms, a frame) comes from it. Not yet profiled.
- **Hold notes' ends are not played** by the automatic player (their length is not decoded yet): about 4 misses a
  song. The chart's lane word has flags above the lane (0x1000, 0x0400, 0x0800 on holds; 0x10000 on fever
  scratches) whose meanings are inferred, not read from the code.
- **Only one song has been played to the end** (song 1, Normal), and only by the automatic player; others, the
  other difficulties, Story Mode's dances and the add-on songs are untested.
- **The game has not been built for Linux.** psvrecore builds and passes its tests on Linux in CI; the game's own
  build and a run there need a Linux machine.
